Hello, this is the Telegram Bot that is currently being developed. 
Me, Myself and I are still enhancing the functionality and testing the bot. 
It's main purpose is to provide AI-generated images based on the text prompt.

The Tech Stack used in this project:
Java-17
Spring Boot 
OkHttp
Lombok
Spring Data JPA
MySQL database

There are some flows that can't be ignored by other programmers, as I suppose, 
although I am working on my application architecture and trying to improve the way
I code through developing such a product.

Thanx for reading, have a nice day!!
